AYTO Project Overview:
Developed a Python GUI for a guessing game using Tkinter, inspired by the game show "Are You the One?".
Assigned by my professor in Spring 2023. All code is my own and I had full creative freedom on how to design the project.
The idea behind the game is to enter in contestent names and essentially play a guessing game with the people that are the most compatible within a certain amount of attempts.

Elevator Project Overview:
****NOTE: All code except one specified class in ECElevatorSim.h is my own (that class was the only starting code our professor gave)

This project was assigned by my professor as a final project in Fall 2024. Our goal was to simulate the backend of an elevator that takes in requests at specific times. 
This simulation needed to be able to handle requests inside and outside the elevator, logic for direction changes, unloading and loading of passengers, etc.
